***When rolling two six-sided dice, each die will show a number
between 1 and 6. When the numbers on the two dice are added 
together, they will sum to a number between 2 and 12.***

***Build an app which rolls a pair of dice 1000 times! 
Recording how frequently each number, 2 to 12, shows up.***


Part 1:
a. Create a function called rollDie() 
which returns a random number between 1-6.
b.Then make another function which 
rolls two dice and adds together the sum.
    -Hint: The second function can call your *rollDie()* function! 
    If you call it twice, you can then add the two 
    numbers together to get the sum.
c.In the HTML, there is already a button with the id roll 
and a div with the id result. Using JavaScript,get both of
those items by id and assign them to variables.
d.Create an event listener on the button for the "click" event. 
Make a callback function and pass it into the click event.
e.In this callback function, call your rollDie() method and 
store the number in a variable.
    -Output a sentence stating what number was rolled to 
    the "result" div.
    -Your app should now be working like the app above!

Part 2:
***Next you are going to keep track off every dice roll. 
At the top of your JS file is the results array.
let results = [null, null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
Use this array to keep track of how many times each 
result has occurred.***
a.***Notice the two nulls at the beginning of the array. When you 
roll two dice and add them, they will produce a number between 
2 and 12. So it is not possible to get a 0 or a 1!***
b.***You can use that number as the index of the array, and 
increment that number. Now the number in the sixth position 
would be 1. Every time you roll a number, you increment that
index by one. Then you know how many times that number was 
rolled!***
c.Then render each value of the results array inside of the
"graph" div.
    -To do this, create a new function renderGraph(). Have 
    that function loop through the results array. For every 
    value create a div and add it to the graph, adding the 
    number into the div.
    -You can set the "graph" div to be a flexbox container 
    to have them display horizontally.

Step 3:
a.Next, add another button to your HTML and give it an id. This 
button should Roll 1000 pairs of dice!
b.Create the event listener and callback just like the other button.
Have your callback run a loop 1000 times, rolling a pair of dice 
and recording the result into the results array each time.
